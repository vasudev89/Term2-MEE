# Chandan Sir: Discussion on 24/11/2020

## Discussion on Demonitization
- Not the best way to control black money
- Reducing Personal Income Tax is the better way to reduce Black Money
- Singapore and Hong Kong are good examples
- Vibhash: In India 1.5 Cr people pay tax
- Too much or only policing is not okay: Does not help

## Revision of Previous Class
- Increasing Price = Reduced Money Supply = LM will shift left-up
- M/P2 < M/P1 = Y2 < Y1 while P1 > P2

## US Recession of 2001
- Demand Shocks moved the IS Curve
	- Tech Bubble Burst
	- 9/11 led to a 12% fall in stock prices in 1 week and a huge rise in uncertainty
	- Scandals @ Enron, WorldCom, and other corps led to stock price declines and a decline in trust and a rise in uncertainty
	- Lower household wealth reduced C0 and higher ucnertainty reduced I0

## Numerical
- C = 0.8(1-t)Y
- t = 0.25
- I = 900 - 50i
- Gbar = 800
- Mbar/Pbar = 500

IS => C + I + Gbar = Y
Thus, Y = 0.8(1-t)Y + 900 - 50i + 800

LM => 500 = 0.25Y - 62.5i

i = 6, Y = 3500

## Monetory and Fiscal Policy
- Fiscal policy has its initial impact in the goods market
- Monetory Policy has its initial impact mainly in the assets markets
- Because the goods and assets markets are interconnected, both fiscal and monetory policies have effects on both the level of o/p and int rates

## Monetory Policy
- Money has a role on real economy as opposed to common belief
- Change in money supply changes Level of Money impacting the o/p in the economy

## Transmission Mechanism
- Refer to PPT

## The Liquidity Trap
- Two extreme cases when effects of monetory policy on economy are studied
	1. Liquity Trap: a situation in which public is prepared to hold whatever amount of money is supplied for any given int rate
	2. LM curve is horizontal: changes in qty of money does not shift it
		- Mon Policy has no impact on int rate/income -> mon policy is powerless
		- Possibility of a liquidity trap at low int rates is a notion that grew out of the theories of English economist John Maynard Keynes
		- Occurs when inflation is 0 or -ve

- Inapplicability of Monetory Policy
- Greece has sacrificed Monetory Policy since it's part of European Economic Union
