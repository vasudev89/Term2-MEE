## Numerical
- C = 0.8(1-t)Y
- t = 0.25
- I = 900 - 50i
- Gbar = 800
- L = 
- Mbar/Pbar = 500

IS => C + I + Gbar = Y
Thus, Y = 0.8(1-t)Y + 900 - 50i + 800

LM => 500 = 0.25Y - 62.5i

i = 6, Y = 3500

## Monetory and Fiscal Policy
- Fiscal policy has its initial impact in the goods market
- Monetory Policy has its initial impact mainly in the assets markets
- Because the goods and assets markets are interconnected, both fiscal and monetory policies have effects on both the level of o/p and int rates
