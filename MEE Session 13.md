## Macroeconomics Updates
- 1st Qtr = -7%
- Q2 __GDP__ updates will be released today

## Liquidity Trap
- Indicates serious structural pblms in economy
Recommendations:
1. Keep Patience
2. Use Fiscal Policy even though it has its own limitations
3. Even though Monetary Policy is not working still work towards expansion

## Bank's Reluctance to Lend
- 2 Extreme cases arise when discussing the effects of monetary policy on the economy => Bank's Reluctance to Lend
- Another situation in which mon pol is powerless to alter the economy -> break down in the transmission mech
- Despite lower int rate & inc demand for investment, banks may be unwilling to make the loans necessary for the investment purchases
	- If banks made prior bad loans that are not repaid, may become reluctant to make more, despite demand -> prefer instead to lend to the gvt(safer)
- Finance Sector usage:
	- Providing finance
	- Non Productive Capital Asset will transfer to Productive Side
	- Risk Factor - Risk Spread and Pooling
- Banks
	- Internal Audit
	- External Audit
	- RBI Audit

## The Classical Case
- LM Curve
	- Short Run = Vertical
	- Long Run = Horizontal

## Crowding Out
- Gvt spending crowd out pvt players
- G is a part of A
- t is a part og the multiplier
- When G rises which component will increase?
	- Consumption C
- When G increases IS will move outward
- int rate will subsequently rise
