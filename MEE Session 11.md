## Money, Interest and Income Revision
- Bond Market determines initial Interest Rate
- However, subsequent int rate will be defined by G&S Mkt and other factors such as imports
- Income can have implications on money mkts
- Understanding the IS Curve
	- b and alphaG determine slope of IS Curve
		- if small then slope of IS curve is vertical
- Int Investment Curve

## Position of IS Curve
- Any factor change in fiscal policy or instruments will cause change in position of IS Curve
- Expansion will shift IS Curve left and vice-versa

## LM Curve
- Combination of interest rate and levels of output such that money demand equals money supply -> equilibrium in the money mkt
- Derived in 2 steps:
	- Understand Demand for Money Equation
		- Transaction Purpose/Motive: We need liquidity to smoothly do transactions
			- True for household and businesses
		- Use liquidity to earn income
			- Deploy funds in purchasing gold
		- Rate of Return
			- Int Rate is a good proxy for Rate of Return
		- Higher Income = Higher Liquidity Demand. More income means more spending
		- If int rate is high then I'd like to hold money in bank
		- Demand for Money depends on
			- Real Income
			- Int Rate
			- Cost of Withdrawal(Penalty on FD)
			- Cost of Access(Remote Area - Credit Card is not accepted, Bank is Far Away) => People will hold more cash
			- Emergency
		- L = f(Y,i) = kY - hi
		- L = Demand for Money
		- k = Sensitivity of L to change in Income
		- h(speculative) = Sensitivity of L to change in Int Rate
	- Demand & Supply for liquidity determination

## Monetory Policy Control
- Open Mkt Ops: Buying & Selling Bonds
- CRR(Cash Reserve Ratio): Proportion of Bank's Money to be maintained with Central Bank
- Discount Rate: Banks can borrow from central bank at a given rate of int for a short-term
	- Does not have collateral

## Repo Rate: 
- Repurchase Agreement Rate
- Has collateral

## Interest Rate vs L with Y
- Y(Income) is given
- M/Price = Real Money Supply
- Section 17-4 of Book
- Liquidity Preference Theory: Keynes

## LM Curve
- identify mkt clearance for a given int rate = i1
- identify mkt clearance for a given int rate = i2
- LM Curve is positively sloped
	- Inc in int rate income raises

## Slope of LM Curve
- Large k = Vertical LM Curve and Vice Versa
- Large h = Horizontal LM Curve and Vice Versa

## M/P = money supply and price

## Position of LM Curve
- Expansion in Money Supply = Rightward shift in LM Curve and vice versa
- Similar to IS Curve
