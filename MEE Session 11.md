## Money, Interest and Income Revision
- Bond Market determines initial Interest Rate
- However, subsequent int rate will be defined by G&S Mkt and other factors such as imports
- Income can have implications on money mkts
- Understanding the IS Curve
	- b and alphaG determine slope of IS Curve
		- if small then slope of IS curve is vertical
- Int Investment Curve

## Position of IS Curve
- Any factor change in fiscal policy or instruments will cause change in position of IS Curve
- Expansion will shift IS Curve left and vice-versa

## LM Curve
- Combination of interest rate and levels of output such that money demand equals money supply -> equilibrium in the money mkt
- Derived in 2 steps:
	- Understand Demand for Money Equation
		- Transaction Purpose/Motive: We need liquidity to smoothly do transactions
			- True for household and businesses
		- Use liquidity to earn income
			- Deploy funds in purchasing gold
		- Rate of Return
			- Int Rate is a good proxy for Rate of Return
		- Higher Income = Higher Liquidity Demand. More income means more spending
		- If int rate is high then I'd like to hold money in bank
		- Demand for Money depends on
			- Real Income
			- Int Rate
			- Cost of Withdrawal(Penalty on FD)
			- Cost of Access(Remote Area - Credit Card is not accepted, Bank is Far Away) => People will hold more cash
			- Emergency
		- L = f(Y,i) = kY - hi
		- L = Demand for Money
		- k = Sensitivity of L to change in Income
		- h = Sensitivity of L to change in Int Rate
	- Demand & Supply for liquidity determination
