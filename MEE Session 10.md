## Monetory Policy
- Money plays a central role in income and employment
- Interest rate will impact investment
- Determining interest rate
- Goods & Services Mkt(GSM)
- Better Interest Rate will increase demand

## Introduction
- IS-LM Curve: 
	- Investment Saving Curve
	- Liquid Money: Money or Assets Mkt
- Interest Rate

## Structure of ISLM
- Goods Market(Influenced by Fiscal Policy)
	- Will determine income
	- Aggregate Demand O/p
- Assets Mkt(Monetary Policy will strongly influence)
	- Money Mkt: Banking
	- Bond Mkt: All bonds - Gvt, Corporate etc
- Income will impact both markets
- Bond Mkt will impact interest rates which will impact Goods Mkt
- Bond Example:
	- Worth 800
	- Return 1000(Estimated)

## Goods Mkt and IS Curve
- Combination of interest rates and levels of o/p such that planned spending equals income
- 2 Steps
	1. Link b/w Int Rate(IR) and Invst
	2. Link b/w Invst Demand and AD
- Invst is no longer treated as exogenous, but dependent upon IR
- Invst is a function of Int Rate(Cost of Borrowing Money)
- I = f(i) => I = invst, i = int rate
- Theoretical Eq: I = Ibar - bi where b >0 => b = responsiveness of invst spending to the int rate
- Emperical Eq: I = Ibar - bi + e => Actual, e is error
- Negative slope reflects assumption that a reduction in i increases the qty of I

## The Interest Rate and AD: The IS Curve
- Need to modify the AD func of the last chapter to reflect the new planned invst spend schedule
- AD = C + I + G + NX = Cbar +c * TRbar + c(1-t)Y + (Ibar - bi) + Gbar + NXbar = Abar + c(1-t)Y -bi
- bar is applied on a variable when it is an autonomous factor: We cannot correctly determine it
- An inc in i reduces AD for a given level of income

## Understanding Eqns
- Y = f(X,Z,M)
- Y is indogenous factor, X,Z,M are extrogenous factors 
- if X = f(Z,M) then, both Y and X are indogenous

## IS Curve Definition
- AD = Abar + c(1-t)Y - bi
- Curve of I vs i: plot points for i vs I
- if i decreases I will inc
- Eq 1: Abar + c(1-t)Y - b * i1
- Eq 2: Abar + c(1-t)Y - b * i2
- i1 and i2 are int rates

## Regression
- Y = c + mX => Linear
- Y = c + m1\*X + M2\*X^2 => also Linear(Determined by Coefficients m1 and m2 not on X and X^2)
