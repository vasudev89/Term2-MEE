## Monetory Policy
- Money plays a central role in income and employment
- Interest rate will impact investment
- Determining interest rate
- Goods & Services Mkt(GSM)
- Better Interest Rate will increase demand

## Introduction
- IS-LM Curve: 
	- Investment Saving Curve
	- Liquid Money: Money or Assets Mkt
- Interest Rate

## Structure of ISLM
- Goods Market(Influenced by Fiscal Policy)
	- Will determine income
	- Aggregate Demand O/p
- Assets Mkt(Monetary Policy will strongly influence)
	- Money Mkt: Banking
	- Bond Mkt: All bonds - Gvt, Corporate etc
- Income will impact both markets
- Bond Mkt will impact interest rates which will impact Goods Mkt
- Bond Example:
	- Worth 800
	- Return 1000(Estimated)

## Goods Mkt and IS Curve
- Combination of interest rates and levels of o/p such that planned spending equals income
- 2 Steps
	1. Link b/w Int Rate(IR) and Invst
	2. Link b/w Invst Demand and AD
- Invst is no longer treated as exogenous, but dependent upon IR
- Invst is a function of Int Rate(Cost of Borrowing Money)
- I = f(i) => I = invst, i = int rate
- Theoretical Eq: I = Ibar - bi where b >0 => b = responsiveness of invst spending to the int rate
- Emperical Eq: I = Ibar - bi + e => Actual, e is error
- Negative slope reflects assumption that a reduction in i increases the qty of I
