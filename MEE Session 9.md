## Role of Government
- Govt Expenditure(G)
- Taxes(TA) and Transfers(TR)

- Fiscal Policy: policy of govt with regard to G, TR, and TA
> AD = A + c(1-t)Y
>
> c is a multiplier

- multiplier works like an automatic stabilizer
- 2008 fiscal crisis penetrated India
	- Low Export
		- Output will decrease e.g. by 100 Cr
		- Multiply with multiplier(100 * alpha) => impact will be reduced on our economy
	- Low Capital Flow from US to India
	- Confidence Level

### Income Taxes as an Automatic Stabilizer
- Part of developed countries(US)
- Low employment = Govt Benefits which control reduction in consumption
- Tax enables a country to provide such benefits

### Effects of Change in Fiscal Policy
- delta Y = 1/1-c(1-t) * delta G = alpha * delta G
