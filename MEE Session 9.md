# Chandan Sir: Discussion on 18/11/2020

## Project Discussion
Key Points:
1. Emperical
2. Keep it straight forward
3. Learn Databases, Macroeconomic Analysis

*Note*: No Plagiarism

- Macro Level Topic, Such as:
	- Monteroy Policy
	- Inflation
	- Trade
	- Exchange rate
		- Uncertainty
	- Government Expenditure
	- Taxes
	- Fiscal Policy in India or other country
	- Fiscal Deficit
	- Comparative Ananlysis with some other country

Analysis of the data
- Statistics may be used
- Cases may be used. Examples:
	- 1991 crisis
	- 1997 crisis
	- 2008 crisis

- Prepare Synopsis of Project
- Introduction + Objectives + Motivation + Data/Model(if applicable) + Outcome expected

- Group Projects
 - Max 4 students per group
 - Individual student is also ok
 - Project topic to be Verified
 - Group formation by CoCo

## Role of Government
- Govt Expenditure(G)
- Taxes(TA) and Transfers(TR)

- Fiscal Policy: policy of govt with regard to G, TR, and TA
> AD = A + c(1-t)Y
>
> c is a multiplier

- multiplier works like an automatic stabilizer
- 2008 fiscal crisis penetrated India
	- Low Export
		- Output will decrease e.g. by 100 Cr
		- Multiply with multiplier(100 * alpha) => impact will be reduced on our economy
	- Low Capital Flow from US to India
	- Confidence Level

### Income Taxes as an Automatic Stabilizer
- Automatic Stabilizer: mechanism in the economy that automatically (without case by case govt intervention) reduces the amount by which o/p changes in response to a change in autonomous demand
- Part of developed countries(US)
- Low employment = Govt Benefits which control reduction in consumption
- Tax enables a country to provide such benefits

### Effects of Change in Fiscal Policy
> delta Y = 1/1-c(1-t) * delta G = alpha * delta G
- delta Y = change in income
- delta G = change in govt spending
- alpha = multiplier

- Suppose Gvt incr TR
- Gvt has 500 cr to stimulate demand in the country
- Option 1: Use G
	- if multiplier = 5 the 500 Cr becomes 2500 Cr
	- buy 500 cr worth of trucks from the automotive sector
- Option 2: Use TR
	- give 500 Cr to bank accounts
	- people save 20%
	- 400 Cr left for circulation

> G Route is better than TR since multiplier helps enhance value more than TR

- Multiplier affected by Taxes

## Types of Deficit/Gvt Budget
- Surplus
- Deficit
	- Revenue = Total Revenue Exp - Tot Rev receipts
	- Fiscal = Total Exp - Tot Receipts excluding borrowings
	- Primary = Fiscal deficit - Interest Payment

- Gvt Budget:
	- Both accounts have receipt and exp
	- Revenue Acct
		- Taxes - such as toll taxes
		- Wages/Salary
		- Will not affects assets
		- Profits made
		- Expenses Made
	- Capital Acct:
		- Effect on assets
		- Disinvestment -> Selling companies/assets
		- Borrowing: Loan payment
		- Loan Disbursement

## Fiscal Deficit Trend:
- Declining Trend for FD, RD, PD
- High Growth: Deficit Decreases
- Crisis: Deficit Rises
- Less o/p = less tax collection => Revenue will fall short
- Expenditure rises
- Stimulus needs to be provided by the gvt
- 2003 to 2008: Deficit was declining strongly
- 2008: Crisis => Deficit rose significantly
- No specific threshold for positive/negative classification
	- Varies by country
	- Varies by regions in a country

#### Question: Fiscal Deficit = Fiscal Debt. How to tackle the pblm?
- In India, we dont have much space
- Borrowing from foreign countries => risky
- China and Japan can borrow from foreing country since they have assets and capital
- Depends on kind of debt: long, short, medium
- Figures out mechanisms to pay

#### Question: Surplus is also not good for Developing Countries like India?
- Gvt needs to spend
- Should not save too much
- Example: North East region needs infra support

### Budget Surplus(BS) = tY - G - TR

#### Question: What will happen to BS if G rises?
- if G goes up, o/p will incr, delta Y = alpha * delta G
- Some part will come as tax collection, but not entirely
- Stimulus given, BS will go down
- Fiscal deficit will go up

## Software Discussion
- STATA Software

## Money Factor
- Money plays a central role in the determination of income and employment
	- Interest rates are a significant detrminant of aggregate spending -> RBI controls the money supply in India
	- The stock of money, interest rates, and RBI were noticeably absent from the model developed in the last chapter
